	abstract = {Visual geo-localization enables the UAV to know its position in GNSS-denied application scenarios, such as disaster emergency response, forest inventory management and indoor facility monitoring. However, there are still some challenges in using oblique-view imagery, especially for UAV images with large oblique viewing angles, to perform visual geo-localization. On the one hand, using geotags of references as image-level geo-localization results is insufficient for oblique-view imagery, because the UAV is often situated at a distance and not directly over the observation area. On the other hand, the obvious differences in viewpoint, viewing angle, and scale between UAV oblique-view images and geo-tagged orthographic reference images severely limit the accuracy of all three steps in pixel-level geo-localization, including image-based retrieval, matching and space resection. In this study, we proposed a coarse-to-fine visual geo-localization method to address these challenges for UAV position determination using oblique-view imagery, assisted by orthographic references. Firstly, we proposed a novel image-level geo-localization method by employing Segments Direction Statistics (SDS) feature patterns and bilateral retrieval strategy. Secondly, we matched UAV oblique-view images with geo-tagged orthographic reference images using feature points and descriptors extracted by the improved SuperPoint network, incorporating the Discrete Gaussian Pyramid Module (DGPM) and the Two-stage Matching Results Refinement Module (TMRRM). Thirdly, based on the matched points with 2D pixel coordinates and 3D ground coordinates, we adopted the triangular pyramid constrained resection method with angle similarity constraints to accurately determine the pixel-level position of UAV. We conducted experiments using a publicly available multi-view images dataset (University-1652), as well as two self-collected datasets of oblique-view images captured by UAVs. Experiments indicate that the localization error of the proposed method is less than 0.1 m for applications with the flight height about 200 m. Meanwhile, the error is about 10 m for UAVs with extremely high flight height (more than 4 km) and large oblique viewing angle (more than 60°). And the average time cost of the proposed method is about 400 ms. Therefore, experimental results demonstrated the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed method in automatically obtaining reliable UAV positions using oblique-view imagery, as well as its robustness for various UAV oblique-view image-based applications.}

	abstract = {Camera-based indoor localization is a fundamental aspect of indoor navigation, virtual reality, and location-based services. Deep learning methods have exhibited remarkable performance with low storage requirements and high efficiency. However, existing methods mainly derive features implicitly for pose regression without considering explicit structure information from images. This paper proposes that incorporating such information can improve the localization performance of learning-based approaches. We extract structure information from RGB images in the form of depth maps and edge maps and design two modules for depth-weighted and edge-weighted feature fusion. These modules are integrated into the pose regression network to enhance pose prediction. Furthermore, we employ a self-attention module for high-level feature extraction to augment the network capacity. Extensive experiments are conducted on the publicly available 7Scenes and 12Scenes datasets, and the results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves high localization performance, with an average positional error of 0.19m and 0.16m, respectively.

	abstract = {Leakage-induced soil erosion poses a major threat to dike failure, particularly during floods. Timely detection and notification of leakage outlets to dike management are crucial for ensuring dike safety. However, manual inspection, the current main approach for identifying leakage outlets, is costly, inefficient, and lacks spatial coverage. To achieve efficient and automatic localization of dike leakage outlets, an innovative strategy combining drones, infrared thermography, and deep learning is presented. Drones are employed for dikes’ surface sensing. Real-time images from these drones are sent to a server where well-trained detectors are deployed. Once a leakage outlet is detected, alarming information is remotely sent to dike managers. To realize this strategy, 4 thermal imagers were employed to image leaking outlets of several models and actual dikes. 9,231 hand-labeled thermal images with 13,387 leaking objects were selected for analysis. 19 detectors were trained using transfer learning. The best detector achieved a mean average precision of 95.8 % on the challenging test set. A full-scale embankment was constructed for leakage outlet detection tests. Various field tests confirmed the efficiency of the proposed leakage outlet localization method. In some tough conditions, the trained detector also evidently outperformed manual judgement. Results indicate that under typical circumstances, the localization error of the proposed method is within 5 m, demonstrating its practical reliability. Finally, the influencing factors and limits of the suggested strategy are thoroughly examined.}

	abstract = {The ability to localise is key for robot navigation. We describe an efficient method for vision-based localisation, which combines sequential Monte Carlo tracking with matching ground-level images to 2-D cartographic maps such as OpenStreetMaps. The matching is based on a learned embedded space representation linking images and map tiles, encoding the common semantic information present in both and providing potential for invariance to changing conditions. Moreover, the compactness of 2-D maps supports scalability. This contrasts with the majority of previous approaches based on matching with single-shot geo-referenced images or 3-D reconstructions. We present experiments using the StreetLearn and Oxford RobotCar datasets and demonstrate that the method is highly effective, giving high accuracy and fast convergence.},

abstract = {Application of UAVs (Unmanned Aerial Vehicles) in environments devoid of GNSS (Global Navigation Satellite System) service has motivated research into GNSS-independent navigation solutions. This paper presents an account of such solutions proposed within the last decade. Unlike most literature that abstract UAV navigation to mere localization, this work takes a bottom-up approach by assessing the navigation components namely perception, localization and motion planning presented in the selected literature. The review results indicate that only 16% of the research presented full navigation solutions, while the rest present one or several components thereof. Besides the account of navigation solutions, our other contributions include an adapted MTOW-based (Maximum Take-Off Weight) UAV classification scheme incorporating a nano-sized UAV class, technology maturity assessment of the reviewed GNSS-independent navigation solutions and analysis of integrity monitoring frameworks.}

abstract = {Localization of autonomous unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) relies heavily on Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS), which are susceptible to interference. Especially in security applications, robust localization algorithms independent of GNSS are needed to provide dependable operations of autonomous UAVs also in interfered conditions. Typical non-GNSS visual localization approaches rely on known starting pose, work only on a small-sized map, or require known flight paths before a mission starts. We consider the problem of localization with no information on initial pose or planned flight path. We propose a solution for global visual localization on large maps, based on matching orthoprojected UAV images to satellite imagery using learned season-invariant descriptors, and test with environment sizes up to 100 km2. We show that the method is able to determine heading, latitude and longitude of the UAV at 12.6–18.7 m lateral translation error in as few as 23.2–44.4 updates from an uninformed initialization, also in situations of significant seasonal appearance difference (winter–summer) between the UAV image and the map. We evaluate the characteristics of multiple neural network architectures for generating the descriptors, and likelihood estimation methods that are able to provide fast convergence and low localization error. We also evaluate the operation of the algorithm using real UAV data and evaluate running time on a real-time embedded platform. We believe this is the first work that is able to recover the pose of an UAV at this scale and rate of convergence, while allowing significant seasonal difference between camera observations and map.}
